<p>50+ words about your Google Doodle.</p>
<p>My Google Doodle is based on me and my girlfriend. She has been very involved in my education and motivates me to finish homework and projects. I thought this would be a small and cute way to recognize what she has done for me. I don&#39;t currently have a laptop/computer because our cat broke mine and I have had to use my girlfriend&#39;s. Which is just another reason I wanted to honor her with something. </p>
